# Untitled Docs

A PDoc replacement written in Rust.

## Roadmap

- Parsing Logic - the first goal is to read a python file, build an AST and generate a docs page
- Optimise CLI experience - similar behaviour to PDoc and other popular variants with configs
- Templating - allowing customisation of pages being generated
- Additional Features - migration checker, editor and dependency graph
